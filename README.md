# My bspwm configuration

I use [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm) as a window manager.
This repo contains its configuration file and some related scripts.

## Requirements

- A hotkey daemon: [sxhkd](https://github.com/baskerville/sxhkd).
- A tool to set window manager name:
  [wmname](https://tools.suckless.org/x/wmname).
- A desktop daemon: [pcmanfm](https://github.com/lxde/pcmanfm).
- A status bar: [polybar](https://github.com/polybar/polybar).
- A compositor: [picom](https://github.com/yshui/picom).
- A notification daemon: [dunst](https://github.com/dunst-project/dunst).
